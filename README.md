npm install

npm run serve

### Important Notice
Note: For the purpose of this task and to ensure that the project works seamlessly from the first run, I have included the API key directly in the repository. This is strictly for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, sensitive information such as API keys should never be committed to the repository.
